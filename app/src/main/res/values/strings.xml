    <string name="president_message">Students’ Council Week is here yet again and it’s another opportunity for us to pause and celebrate this milestone of the 41st year of the movements’ existence. The theme for this year’s SCW is “Positioned for Greatness,” a declaration that is both powerful and prophetic, as this is manifested daily in the lives of students and youth. These individuals have and continue to make stellar contributions in various spheres of life such as academics, sports and volunteerism just to name a few. Zig Ziglar once said, “Man was designed for accomplishment, engineered for success, and endowed with the seeds of greatness”.</string>
